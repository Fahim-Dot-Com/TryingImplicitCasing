# TryingImplicitCasing
# C# Implicit Casting Example

This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates **implicit casting** (also known as automatic type conversion) from an `int` to a `double`.

## üìå What It Does

The program defines an integer value and assigns it to a double variable. Since this is a **safe and widening conversion**, it happens automatically. The program then prints both values to the console.

### Output:
```
9
9
```

Note: The second line appears as `9`, but it is technically a `double` (i.e., `9.0`), depending on formatting and context.

## üí° Concept Demonstrated

- **Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion)**: 
  - When a smaller type is converted to a larger type without needing manual conversion.
  - Example: `int ‚Üí double`

## üß† Code Overview

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      int myInt = 9;
      double myDouble = myInt;  // Automatic casting: int to double

      Console.WriteLine(myInt);     // Outputs 9
      Console.WriteLine(myDouble);  // Outputs 9 (as a double)
    }
  }
}
```
